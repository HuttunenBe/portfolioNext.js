# 🌐 Drupal Portfolio
A simple portfolio website I made part of studies for content management course. The app gets data from Drupal and shows it on a Next.js website.The app includes pages  Home, About, Projects, Blog and Contact. It uses React Router to move between pages.

## ✨ Features
* 🏠 Home: Shows welcome text, image and links to GitHub + LinkedIn from Drupal
